                        there is a huge marine diversity and untouched reefs to explore. Sloping reefs, caves, coral
                        gardens, overhangs, and shipwrecks are some of the attractions a diver could explore. Of the 4
                        islands where scuba diving is possible, Bangaram and Kadmat are quite popular while Minicoy and
                        Kavaratti are remote and relatively not busy. Kavaratti offers caves to explore while Bangaram
                        and Minicoy offer shipwreck dives.

                    <p>Kayaking is an amazing way to enjoy the turquoise blue coral beaches of Lakshadweep. Kayaking is
                        a water sport using a Kayak for moving across water. A Kayak is a narrow watercraft that is
                        propelled by a double-bladed paddle. Unlike a Canoe, this is differentiated by the sitting
                        position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. Experts are available at every
                        resort offering this activity making it all the more easy for beginners to start enjoying this
                        sport. Your much-needed peace and quiet is just a Kayak away.

                        in to a parachute and is pulled along by a boat. Bangaram and Kadmat are probably the most
